## 🚧 Step-by-Step Guide

### 1️⃣ Create a New AVS Project (`avs create`)

Sets up a new AVS project with the recommended structure, configuration files, and boilerplate code. This helps you get started quickly without needing to manually organize files or determine a layout. Details:

* Initializes a new project based on the default Hourglass task-based architecture in Go. Refer to [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/hourglass-avs-template?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-hourglass) for details on the Hourglass architecture.
* Generates boilerplate code and default configuration.

Projects are created by default in the current directory from where the below command is called.

```bash
devkit avs create my-avs-project
cd my-avs-project
```

> Note: Projects are created with a specific template version. You can view your current template version with `devkit avs template info` and upgrade later using `devkit avs template upgrade`.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> All subsequent `devkit avs` commands must be run from the root of your AVS project—the directory containing the [config](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/devkit-cli/tree/main/config) folder. The `config` folder contains the base `config.yaml` with the `contexts` folder which houses the respective context yaml files, example `devnet.yaml`.

### 2️⃣ Configure Your AVS (`avs config`)

Before running your AVS, you'll need to configure both project-level and environment-specific settings. This is done through two configuration files:

- **`config.yaml`**: Defines project-wide settings such as AVS name and context names.
- **`contexts/devnet.yaml`**: Contains environment-specific settings for your a given context (i.e. devnet), including the Ethereum fork url, block height, operator keys, AVS keys, and other runtime parameters.

You can view or modify these configurations using the DevKit CLI or by editing the files manually.

View current settings via CLI:

```bash
devkit avs config
```

Edit settings directly via CLI:

```bash
devkit avs config --edit --path <path to the config.yaml or contexts/devnet.yaml file>
```

Alternatively, manually edit the config files in the text editor of your choice.

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> These commands must be run from your AVS project's root directory.

### 3️⃣ Build Your AVS

Compiles your AVS contracts and offchain binaries. Required before running a devnet or simulating tasks to ensure all components are built and ready.

* Compiles smart contracts using Foundry.
* Builds operator, aggregator, and AVS logic binaries.

Ensure you're in your project directory before running:

```bash
devkit avs build
```

### 4️⃣ Launch Local DevNet

Starts a local devnet to simulate the full AVS environment. This step deploys contracts, registers operators, and runs offchain infrastructure, allowing you to test and iterate without needing to interact with testnet or mainnet.

* Forks Ethereum mainnet using a fork URL (provided by you) and a block number. These URLs CAN be set in the `config/context/devnet.yaml`, but we recommend placing them in a `.env` file which will take precedence over `config/context/devnet.yaml`. Please see `.env.example`.
* Automatically funds wallets (`operator_keys` and `submit_wallet`) if balances are below `10 ether`.
* Setup required `AVS` contracts.
* Register `AVS` and `Operators`.


> \[!IMPORTANT]
> You **must** set valid `*_FORK_URL`s before launching your local devnet.  
> Add them to your `.env` (copied from `.env.example`) or to `config/context/devnet.yaml`.

> **Note:** Use any popular RPC provider (e.g. QuickNode, Alchemy) for `FORK_URL`.

This step is essential for simulating your AVS environment in a fully self-contained way, enabling fast iteration on your AVS business logic without needing to deploy to testnet/mainnet or coordinate with live operators.

```
$ cp .env.example .env
# edit `.env` and set your L1_FORK_URL and L2_FORK_URL before proceeding
```

After adding `*_FORK_URL`s, run this from your project directory:

```bash
devkit avs devnet start
```

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> Please ensure your Docker daemon is running before running this command.

DevNet management commands:

| Command | Description                                                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------                             |
| `start` | Start local Docker containers and contracts                             |
| `stop`  | Stop and remove container from the avs project this command is called   |
| `list`  | List active containers and their ports                                  |
| `stop --all`  | Stops all devkit devnet containers that are currently currening                                  |
| `stop --project.name`  | Stops the specific project's devnet                                  |
| `stop --port`  | Stops the specific port .ex: `stop --port 8545`                                  |

### 5️⃣ Simulate Task Execution (`avs call`)

Triggers task execution through your AVS, simulating how a task would be submitted, processed, and validated. Useful for testing end-to-end behavior of your logic in a local environment.

* Simulate the full lifecycle of task submission and execution.
* Validate both off-chain and on-chain logic.
* Review detailed execution results.

Run this from your project directory:

```bash
devkit avs call -- signature="(uint256,string)" args='(5,"hello")'
```

Optionally, submit tasks directly to the on-chain TaskMailBox contract via a frontend or another method for more realistic testing scenarios.

---

## Optional Commands

### Start offchain AVS infrastructure (`avs run`)

Run your offchain AVS components locally.

* Initializes the Aggregator and Executor Hourglass processes.

This step is optional. The devkit `devkit avs devnet start` command already starts these components. However, you may choose to run this separately if you want to start the offchain processes without launching a local devnet — for example, when testing against a testnet deployment.

> Note: Testnet support is not yet implemented, but this command is structured to support such workflows in the future.

```bash
devkit avs run
```

### Deploy AVS Contracts (`avs deploy-contract`)

Deploy your AVS's onchain contracts independently of the full devnet setup.

This step is **optional**. The `devkit avs devnet start` command already handles contract deployment as part of its full setup. However, you may choose to run this command separately if you want to deploy contracts without launching a local devnet — for example, when preparing for a testnet deployment.

> Note: Testnet support is not yet implemented, but this command is structured to support such workflows in the future.

```bash
devkit avs deploy-contract
```

### Create Operator Keys (`avs keystore`)
Create and read keystores for bn254 private keys using the CLI. 

- To create a keystore
```bash
devkit keystore create --key --path --password
```

- To read an existing keystore
```bash
devkit keystore read --path --password
```

**Flag Descriptions**
- **`key`**: Private key in BigInt format . Example: `5581406963073749409396003982472073860082401912942283565679225591782850437460` 
- **`path`**: Path to the json file. It needs to include the filename . Example: `./keystores/operator1.keystore.json`
- **`password`**: Password to encrypt/decrypt the keystore.

### Template Management (`avs template`)

Manage your project templates to stay up-to-date with the latest features and improvements.

* View current template information
* Upgrade your project to a newer template version

Subcommands:

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `info` | Display information about the current project template |
| `upgrade` | Upgrade project to a newer template version |

View template information:
```bash
devkit avs template info
```

Upgrade to a specific template version (tag, branch, or commit hash):
```bash
devkit avs template upgrade --version v1.0.0
```

### 📖 Logging (`--verbose`)

<!-- 
@TODO: bring this back when we reintroduce config log levels
Configure logging levels through `config.yaml`:

```yaml
log:
  level: info  # Options: "info", "debug", "warn", "error"
``` -->

To enable detailed logging during commands:

```bash
devkit avs build --verbose
```

## Upgrade process


### Upgrading the Devkit CLI

To upgrade the Devkit CLI to the latest version, find the [latest release](releases) you want to download and re-run the curl install command:

```bash
VERSION=v0.0.6
ARCH=$(uname -m | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
DISTRO=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')

curl -s -L "https://s3.amazonaws.com/eigenlayer-devkit-releases/${VERSION}/devkit-${DISTRO}-${ARCH}-${VERSION}.tar.gz" | sudo tar xvz -C /usr/local/bin
```

### Upgrading your template

To upgrade the template you created your project with (by calling `devkit avs create`) you can use the `devkit avs template` subcommands.

**_View which version you're currently using_**

```bash
devkit avs template info

2025/05/22 14:42:36 Project template information:
2025/05/22 14:42:36   Project name: <your project>
2025/05/22 14:42:36   Template URL: https://github.com/Layr-Labs/hourglass-avs-template
2025/05/22 14:42:36   Version: v0.0.9
```

**_Upgrade to a newer version_**

To upgrade to a newer version you can run:

```bash
devkit avs template upgrade --version <version>
```

More often than not, you'll want to use tag corresponding to your template's release. You may also provide a branch name or commit hash to upgrade to.

_Please consult your template's docs for further information on how the upgrade process works._
